Your task is to mix ambient sounds by composing a set of ambient audio tracks.
You can assign each track a <volume> between 0 and 100.
You can only use each track once.
Tracks will loop indefinitely unless <random> is set to true.
In this case, the track will repeat randomly every <random_unit> for <random_counter> times.
You can use the following tracks:
{TRACKS}
Your response should be a JSON object of the following format:
---
[
  {
    "name": "<track name>",
    "volume": <the volume>,
    "random": <true or false>,
    "random_counter": <number of times to play the sound every random_unit>,
    "random_unit": "<1m|10m|1h>",
  },
  ...
]
---
I will provide descriptions of the environment and mood I'd like to create an ambient mix for in my next prompt.
